%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% TIPS FOR BIBTEXT ENTRIES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Always use consistent citation keys (e.g., firstauthorYEARfirstword)
% 2. Include DOIs and URLs whenever available
% 3. Use proper capitalization in titles (BibTeX will handle case conversion)
% 4. For author names, use format: "Last Name, First Name"
% 5. Separate multiple authors with "and"
% 6. Use curly braces {} to protect capitalization, e.g., {CNN}, {BERT}
% 7. For conference papers, include the full name of the conference
% 8. For arXiv papers, include both the arXiv identifier and proper classification
% 9. Month fields should use three-letter abbreviations: jan, feb, mar, etc.
% 10. The "note" field is useful for additional information
